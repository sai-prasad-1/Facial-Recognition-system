This project is an automated attendance system that uses facial recognition technology to take attendance of students or employees in an organization. The system uses a camera to capture the image of a person's face, and then matches it with the faces in the database. The project is developed using Java and OpenCV. The GUI is made using JavaFX. The backend is managed using MySQL.
